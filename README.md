- Multithreaded-Networked, Client-Server application in java

This program tranlates the user's input (either a sentence or phrase) into a series dots and dashes provided by the "Morse.txt" file.  
The data file is read and stored in array for easy accesibility and then compared to the user's input and translated using the
